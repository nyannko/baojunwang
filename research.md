## Introduction to Research Interests

Prof. Baojun Wang's research interests are in synthetic biology and bioengineering, mainly including synthetic biology enabling technology development (CRISPR gene editing and regulation, intrinsic peptide-based protein assembly tools), engineering design of gene circuits and innovative applications in biosensing (portable sensors for environmental pollution and health detection), biocomputing, biotherapeutics (tumor bacterial therapy, artificial phage targeted removal of pathogenic bacteria) and biomanufacturing (biofunctional material synthesis, smart cell factory design). In recent years, we have achieved breakthroughs in the development of key enabling technologies in synthetic biology, gene circuit design and applications, including: (1) the first in the world to propose a gene circuit engineering design method and develop innovative applications in ultra-sensitive biosensing and in vivo biocomputing; (2) the first in the world to develop a novel "eukaryotic-like" prokaryotic CRISPR technology. (b) the first in the world to develop a novel "eukaryotic-like" prokaryotic CRISPR gene activation technology, revealing the programmability mechanism of type II CRISPR system crRNA-tracrRNA pairing and pioneering its application in RNA biosensing; (c) proposed a novel split protein design directed evolution method and created the largest standardized orthologous break protein intrinsic peptide library, which solved the problem of precise and seamless in vitro assembly of high repetition structure macromolecule proteins.

## Introduction of Research Achievements

The main innovative academic achievements of Prof. Baojun Wang's team in the field of synthetic biology in recent years are summarized as follows.

(1) The innovative design method of engineering gene circuits was firstly proposed in the international arena: the modularized and orthogonalized gene logic gating circuits and modularized transcriptional signal amplification circuits were designed and constructed, and a new comprehensive optimization design method of gene circuits based on nucleic acid sponges was established, which expanded the innovative application of gene circuits in the field of biosensing. And accordingly, the technological innovation transformation cooperation with Microsoft and Huawei has been carried out.

Due to the high-dimensional nonlinear nature of living systems and the absence of physical insulation between intracellular biomolecules, the vast majority of currently designed gene circuits are small-scale, functionally simple synthetic biological systems composed of a few genetic components with low modularity and orthogonality, and are often constructed based on trial-and-error methods after repeated attempts, which are time-consuming and costly. Therefore, we propose that the design of genetic circuits at scale should be based on the engineering principles of modularity (random substitution and assembly between device input and output signal modules) and orthogonality (including orthogonality of interactions between circuit components and cellular chassis components), and that the properties of the components of genetic circuits should be fully tested in a standardized working environment to improve the functionality of synthetic assemblies of biological systems. Predictability (Nature Commun 2011 doi).

The team was the first to design and construct modular and orthogonalized logical and gated and ungated lines (Nature Commun 2011 doi; Figure 1a) and modular and continuously adjustable transcriptional signal amplification lines (Nucl Acids Res 2014 doi; Figure 1b) in E. coli using heterologous σ54-dependent transcription factors and related gene regulatory elements in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The most sensitive E. coli-based cellular sensor for heavy metal contamination such as arsenic and mercury and an innovative visualization output module were created by cascading multilayer orthogonal modular transcriptional signal amplification lines (Nature Chem Biol 2019 doi; Fig. 1c). Highly specific cell sensors for environmental monitoring were designed by coupling multi-cell population communication controlled by multi-input logic gate lines (Biosens & Bioelectron 2013 doi). Pioneered the proposal and development of a multifunctional gene regulation tool for nucleic acid sponges that can fully optimize the design of synthetic gene circuits, which was first demonstrated to reduce the cellular load caused by heterogeneous protein overexpression (Nature Commun 2020, 11:5961 doi).



(2) We are the first in the world to develop a novel "eukaryotic-like" prokaryotic CRISPRa gene activation technology; we have revealed the programmability mechanism of type II CRISPR system crRNA and tracrRNA matching, and pioneered the application of this discovery in several biotechnology and medical fields.

CRISPR-mediated gene activation and regulation (CRISPRa, CRISPR activation) is a class of gene regulation technology with great potential for application. Its unique programmability and scalability can significantly increase the versatility and standardization of gene activation and regulation components, and has been the subject of much research in synthetic biology. Although CRISPRa is quite mature in eukaryotic cells, in prokaryotic cells, the few built CRISPRa are still restricted by their own characteristics of prokaryotic gene activation mechanisms. For example, the target range of CRISPR activation complex is narrow and does not support multi-target activation of single promoter; the activation output ploidy is low and does not support multi-channel activation and cascade regulation.

The team pioneered the design and development of a novel "eukaryotic-like" CRISPR gene activation and regulation system (Nature Commun 2019, 10:3693 doi; Figure 2a). This system cleverly exploits the unique transcription initiation "blocking" mechanism of bacterial σ54 factor to increase the activation output of prokaryotic CRISPRa by more than one order of magnitude, and achieves the first multi-channel and cascade regulation of CRISPR activation in bacteria. Based on this technology, we pioneered the concept of "reusable" multi-gene expression profile projection library, and established a novel multi-gene metabolic pathway expression profile screening platform. Different multiple gene expression lines can be designed according to standardized design principles, and only a single plasmid needs to be constructed, which greatly reduces the cost of optimizing bacterial multiple gene expression pathways and has broad application prospects. The related technology has been applied for international patent (PCT/GB2020/052031).

Based on the above advances, we have systematically revealed the programmability mechanism of the type II CRISPR system crRNA to tracrRNA matching and demonstrated several powerful applications in biocomputing and biosensing using reprogrammed tracrRNAs (Nature Commun 2022 doi; Figure 2b): including the first reveal of the design principles and orthogonality of reprogrammed tracrRNA-crRNA pairs, the development of a programmable tracrRNA-crRNA pair, and the development of a programmable tracrRNA-crRNA pair. design principles and orthogonality, development of a dual gRNA-mediated CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) system, programmable AND-gate Boolean logic gate device, hijacking of bacterial endogenous environmental response gene transcripts (containing sRNA and mRNA) to detect environmental contaminants, and invention of the highly specific SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA sensor AGATHA.



(3) We are the first in the world to propose a novel split protein design directed evolution method and develop the largest standardized orthologous break protein intrinsic peptide library in the field to date, solving the problem of precise and seamless assembly of highly repetitive structural macromolecular proteins in vitro.

The team established the first high-throughput intein screening and active break site testing platform based on red fluorescent protein, and screened 15 pairs of highly orthogonal split intein components to build the largest orthogonal split intein library to date (Nature Commun 2020, 11:1529 doi; Figure 3a). Using this library of intronic peptides, the precise and seamless assembly of highly repetitive structural macromolecular proteins in vitro has been achieved, solving a long-standing genetic engineering problem that highly repetitive structural macromolecular proteins are difficult to synthesize in heterologous expression systems.
